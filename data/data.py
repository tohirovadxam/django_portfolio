    BIO = """Hi there! My name is Adxam. I have always had a strong interest in technology, but recently I decided to take a big step and start learning how to build it myself. Currently, I am focused on becoming a Full-Stack Django Developer.

To be honest, I really love the process of coding! There is something amazing about writing lines of text and seeing them turn into a working website on a computer or a smartphone. Every time I solve a complex problem or add a new feature to my projects, it gives me a great sense of happiness and motivation to learn more.

I believe that technology is for everyone. If you are someone who enjoys using computers, exploring new apps, or understanding smartphones, I highly recommend that you try learning how to code too. It is a challenging but very rewarding path that opens up a whole new world of creative possibilities.

My current goal is to keep practicing, improve my technical skills, and build high-quality projects that can truly help people. I am excited about the future and look forward to growing as a developer in this ever-changing tech world."""
